E-Commerce Microservices Architecture 🚀

Overview

This project is a scalable, resilient, and event-driven E-Commerce System built using Spring Boot Microservices and Apache Kafka. It follows modern architectural patterns to ensure fault tolerance, real-time processing, and seamless inter-service communication.

🔹 Key Features:

✅ Microservices Architecture – Independently deployable services for Orders, Inventory, Payments, Notifications, and User Management.

✅ Event-Driven Communication – Apache Kafka ensures real-time data streaming and async service communication.

✅ Fault Tolerance & Resilience – Implemented Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j), Bulkhead, and Retry Mechanism to prevent cascading failures.

✅ API Gateway & Security – Spring Cloud Gateway for request routing and JWT-based authentication.

✅ Scalability & Performance – Load balancing (Eureka & Ribbon) and containerized deployment using Docker & Kubernetes.

✅ Distributed Logging & Tracing – Zipkin & Sleuth for end-to-end monitoring of requests across services.

🚀 Problems Solved by This Project

1️⃣ Traditional Monolithic Challenges → Microservices Benefits

🔴 Problem: Traditional e-commerce applications are monolithic, making them difficult to scale and maintain.

✅ Solution: This project breaks down the system into microservices, making it highly modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

2️⃣ Synchronous API Calls → Event-Driven Kafka Messaging

🔴 Problem: Direct API calls create tight coupling between services, leading to failures if a service is down.

✅ Solution: Apache Kafka enables asynchronous, event-driven communication, ensuring loose coupling and high availability.

3️⃣ Single Point of Failure → Resilient Circuit Breakers

🔴 Problem: If one service fails, the entire system might crash.

✅ Solution: Resilience4j Circuit Breakers, Retry, and Bulkhead patterns prevent cascading failures and improve system reliability.

4️⃣ Slow Performance → Distributed Caching & Load Balancing

🔴 Problem: High latency due to database bottlenecks.

✅ Solution: Redis caching speeds up data retrieval, and Eureka with Ribbon enables efficient load balancing.

5️⃣ Difficult Debugging in Distributed Systems → Centralized Logging & Tracing

🔴 Problem: Tracking user requests across multiple services is challenging.

✅ Solution: Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin provide distributed tracing, making debugging easier.
